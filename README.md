# goKnapsack :school_satchel:
Codes written in Go language to solve some variants of the knapsack problem.

## Introduction

This is a simple code to deal with the knapsack problem for different packing method.
The current version of the code deals with methods to treat the bounded, with only 
one copy of each item to be included and bounded (when there is an unlimited numbers
of each element to be included).

### Prerequisites

You need the Go compiler found at [Go](https://golang.org/) (where you can try it online!) 

An overview of the algorithm can be found at [wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knapsack_problem)
